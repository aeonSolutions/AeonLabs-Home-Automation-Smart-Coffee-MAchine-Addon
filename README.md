# Smart Coffee Machine Add-on

### The Problem
Nowadays there are countless coffee machines however with limited to none smart functionality. With this new way of do work remotely buying a cup of coffee for a colleague, friend or family is not possible.  

### The idea
This Home Automation Smart Coffee Machine Addon is easy installation on any home or office coffee machine, to enable any vintage coffee machine connectivity to the internet (or a personal network). The PCB uses an ESP32 S3 packed with Bluetooth, BLE, and WiFi compatible with major software vendors such as Apple Home, Google Home, Matter/Zigbee, Home Assistant, and many others.  

The custom firmware being coded includes the functionality of someone paying for a cup of coffee using any home banking App, Paypal, Stripe on any other means of payment. In return, it sends a receipt as proof a coffee was indeed brewed on the coffee machine. 

**Functionalities available:** 

* Control water temperature;
* Low water detection in the water tank; 
* Order a cup of coffee (with possibility control of quantity of coffee in the cup);
* Grind coffee beans.;
* Connect to a Nextion LCD Touch ;
* RGB LED;
* Magnetic Buzzer;
  

To all those looking for a LCD touch solutions, this PCB features a connection to NEXTION LCD panels so one car order a cup of coffee using the LCD Touch. 

* This PCB can be powered using 220V AC or regular 5V DC. 

* Control of the coffee machine is made using a 220V relays or alternatively any other 3.3V switch. 

Great to do a restoration with this smart PCB add-on on any vintage coffee machine.
