# Smart Coffee Machine add-on 
<sup> <img height="15" src="https://github.com/aeonSolutions/AeonLabs-WIFI-BLE-RFID-NFC-Desk-Contacless-Reader-Writer/blob/main/designs/working_green.png">  **status: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">M.V.P.</a>** NOW SELLING on <a href="https://www.tindie.com/stores/aeonlabs/">Tindie.com</a>  </sup> <br>
 
## Intro
think about the possibility of ordering a cup of coffee directly from Telegram even before you arrive at the cafe on a sunny day.... or sitting inside on a rainy day.....


...imagine the coffee machine replying to you and asking if you want a lot or less sugar. do you want milk in your coffee? Better, what temperature do you want for your coffee.

<br>

### The Problem
Nowadays there are countless coffee machines however with limited to no smart functionality. With this new way of doing work remotely buying a cup of coffee for a colleague, friend or family is not possible.

### The idea
This Home Automation Smart Coffee Machine Addon is easy installation on any home or office coffee machine, to enable any vintage coffee machine connectivity to the internet (or a personal network). The PCB uses an ESP32 S3 packed with Bluetooth, BLE, and WiFi compatible with major software vendors such as Apple Home, Google Home, Matter/Zigbee, Home Assistant, and many others.
The custom firmware being coded includes the functionality of someone paying for a cup of coffee using any home banking App, Paypal, Stripe on any other means of payment. In return, it sends a receipt as proof a coffee was indeed brewed on the coffee machine.

**Functionalities available:** 

* Control water temperature;
* Low water detection in the water tank; 
* Order a cup of coffee (with the possibility control the quantity of coffee in the cup);
* Grind coffee beans.;
* Connect to a Nextion LCD Touch ;
* RGB LED;
* Magnetic Buzzer;
  

To all those looking for LCD touch solutions, this PCB features a connection to NEXTION LCD panels so one can order a cup of coffee using the LCD Touch. 

* This PCB can be powered using 220V AC or regular 5V DC. 

* Control of the coffee machine is made using a 220V relay or alternatively any other 3.3V switch. 

Great to do a restoration with this smart PCB add-on on any vintage coffee machine.

I've contacted Signal ([www.signal.org](http://www.signal.org)) and Mesibo ([https://mesibo.com/](https://mesibo.com/)) App Developers and inquired them with the possibility of this open hardware smart coffee machine pcb add-on be integrated in their messager apps so anyone can order a cup of coffee during a messenger conversation / chat and also during a conference meeting. Stay tuned for updates.

## Try it right now on Telegram 

Is now #official. Anyone can "buy me a coffee" on Telegram. Just start a conversation with **MiguelCoffeeMachineBot** [here](https://t.me/MiguelCoffeeMachineBot) and send a message `/start` to view available commands. 


Available commands:
 - `/start`                      : to view available commands on the Coffee Machine i have at my home
 - `/coffee`                     : to "buy" Miguel a cup of Coffee
 - `/tea`                        : to "buy" Miguel a cup of Tea

 - `/accept`[long/normal/short]  : to accept an offer made by another person
 - `/status`                     : to view the current status of the Philips Senseo Coffee Machine

Try it out is free and is #FUN. No money is asked! Great for a meeting or a conversation online. No excuses not to have a cup of coffee with colleagues while working remotely.

## OEM Firmware code
The OEM version of the firmware code can be found on the folder **firmware code**.  It has by default OTA updates, meaning the smart coffee machine add-on device automatically updates it self when newer updated versions made available here.  


**How to use the firmware code** <br>
Install all library dependecies (see below). <br>
unzip the "firmware code" folder and rename it with the name of the .ino file it contains. <br> 
Open the .ino file in Arduino Studio. <br>
Select the ESP32 S3 MCU / board from the menu, and then the code should compile. if not, follow the instructions shown in the debug console. <br>

**Library Dependencies** <br> 
This code uses my own ESP32 c++ class libraries to expedite development of code of ESP32 microcontrollers.

Prodigio smart coffee machines are only accessible through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This project makes it possible to access them via HTTP/HTTPS, using a RPi 3 as BLE relay.

- [CoffeeMaker](https://github.com/ivanph1017/CoffeeMaker)

This is part of a project to manage a coffee maker at home from a Android mobile phone. It's made up of an Android app written in Kotlin as the front-end, Firebase service as the back-end and Raspberry PI 3 as a single board computer with a script written in Javascript running on Node.JS and integrated to a coffee maker with water level sensors.

The coffee maker can be turned on/off by the Android app. Nonetheless, it can only be kept turned on maximum of 1 hour. If such an amount of time has passed, it automatically turns off and it rests up by 5 minutes in order to be available of turning on again.

- [Coffee Machine Project](http://simcap.github.io/coffeemachine/)

In this Coffe Machine Project, your task is to implement the logic (starting from a simple class) that translates orders from customers of the coffee machine to the drink maker. Your code will use the drink maker protocol to send commands to the drink maker.
